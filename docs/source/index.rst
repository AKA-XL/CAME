CAME
====

CAME is a tool for Cell-type Assignment and Module Extraction,
based on a heterogeneous graph neural network.

To get started, refer to :doc:`_notebooks/getting_started_pipeline_un` and
:doc:`_notebooks/getting_started_pipeline_aligned` for CAME's analysis pipeline
of the cross-species and cross-dataset cell-typing, respectively.
